                        Used a blur filter to get the frosted glass

                            putting the images in this text. I put them in and floated
                            them left and right so the text could wrap around it, added some 
                            margin for clarity purposes, and made sure the words broke as a
                            whole in the css using word-break keep all.

                            I'm currently a student at Penn State studying Risk and Security Analysis with a focus in Cybersecurity. I have been studying ethical hacking, web design, and web based applications for over 3 years now. I have some experience in creating applications in ReactJS, AngularJS,<img src="assets/images/dub.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Dubrovnik, Croatia" height="140px" style="float: left; border-radius: 0; margin-right: 10px "/> and VueJS along with mobile application frameworks like React Native and Expo. I will be graduating from Penn State at the end of 2020, so I am actively searching for projects and places to work to get more experience. Based out of Philadelphia,  I have look at opportunities in many places from New York to Washington D.C. My dream is to do security work for the government, but in the meantime I will be traveliing to Dubrovnik, Croatia to continue my information security studies and to gather more experience working with others from around the globe.
